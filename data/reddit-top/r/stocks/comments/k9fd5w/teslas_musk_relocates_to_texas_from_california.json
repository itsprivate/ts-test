It does not collect personal income tax while California has some of the highest state tax rates in the United States.\n\nA 670% rally in Tesla shares this year has boosted Musk’s net worth from $27 billion to $155 billion, just behind Amazon.com Inc’s Jeff Bezos, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nIn a conversation touching a wide range of topics including government intervention, technology companies and corporate policy, Musk criticized CEOs of other U.S. companies for not focusing enough on their products.\n\n“If you find yourself spending a lot of time giving presentations and reviewing spreadsheets, you’re barking up the wrong tree,” Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire also compared himself to a war general and said, “If you think about war ... do you want the general in some like ivory tower or on the front lines? The troops are going to fight a lot harder if they see the general on the front lines.”\n\nMusk said tech companies in Silicon Valley had too much influence on the world and predicted a decrease in their power.\n\nOn Tesla’s move to raise $5 billion in capital, he said: “We thought we can retire a lot of the debt and increase the security of the company ... have more of a war chest.”\n\nMusk has earned Tesla stock options related to his 2018 pay package that are currently worth almost $20 billion.\n\n[Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-elon-musk-texas-idUSKBN28I2UB)",
