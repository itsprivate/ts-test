Of course I’m doing research and ensuring I pick up items that make sense, but if you had $3K how would you split it up and use it?\n\n1. Any stock recommendations?\n\n2. Generally what is a good number of shares to buy for any given stock?\n\n3. Does it make any sense to buy small amounts like 1-5 shares of a stock?\n\n4. Best way to approach mutual funds?\n\n5. Would I get taxed if I buy a stock and sell it a few days after only to reinvest those sales back into another stock?\n\nThanks!",
